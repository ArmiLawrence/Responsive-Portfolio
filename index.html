                        <p>
                            I was born in Manila, Philippines way back in the 80's. I liked watching anime, movies, TV, and playing outside during our hot summers.

                        <p>
                            I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley many moons ago, with a major in History and minor in City and Regional Planning. 
                            Need for food and shelter hindered my lifelong goal of becoming a hippie, 
                            so I got into maintenance renewals sales. From there, I got into working with data and learned the fun, Microsoft SQL stack and have been 
                            working with data for the last 6 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a twin sister who works at Cal's rival school (sssssss).... In my spare time, I practice kickboxing and karate, and watch a ton of
                            anime. I have no kids, no pets, but don't mind playing with those beings once in a while.
                        </p>
